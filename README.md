I will be researching Goal-Oriented-Action-Planning or GOAP for short.

GOAP is a decision making code structure. It revolves around the AI having a goal, and choosing by itself which actions it will take to reach this goal.
Each action has atleast 1 precondition and 1 effect. The AI uses these preconditions and effects to decide what action to take to accomplish its goal.

Example:

-Agent needs to move from room A to room B. The precondition for this action would be that there needs to be a way to get to room B(eg: door not locked).

-Assuming the path is blocked, it cannot go to room B yet. So the agent needs to find an action that has the effect to clear the path(eg: unlock door).

-Following the door example, the unlockDoorAction will have a precondition "HaveKey". The agent needs an action that has the effect "HaveKey = true;".


It boils down to the AI having a goal it wants to make true and choosing performable actions who's effects result in the AI achieving its goal.

This will definitly use a stack. As every action you finish, will make you want to return to the previous action you were trying to perform but needed to first meet its precondition(s).
